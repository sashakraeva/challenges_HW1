# Arduino Basics Challenges

**Arduino Basics Challenges** repository! üöÄ 
This project contains challenges designed to test and improve basic knowledge of Arduino programming and hardware.

## Challenges Overview

1. **Challenge #1 - Digital Read Switch**  
   ‚Ä¢ Design the switch (with or without a pull-up resistor)
   ‚Ä¢ Control an LED state based on switch state
   ‚Ä¢ Switch pressed (HIGH) ‚Äî> LED ON (High)
   ‚Ä¢ Switch released (LOW) ‚Äî> LED OFF (Low)
   
2. **Challenge #2 - Digital Read Switch**  
     Scenario 1: LED must be ON when the button is not pressed and should be OFF when the button is pressed
     Scenario 2: LED must be ON when the button is pressed, and stay ON for 5 seconds even when the button is released, after that the LED should be OFF
     Scenario 3: Press the button to turn ON the LED and press it again to turn OFF the LED (toggle)

3. **Challege #3 - Digital Read Switch**
     Add one more button connected to Pin 3, use Pull Up or Pull Down resistor if necessary. Let‚Äôs call this Button2 and the previous one as Button1
     Add one LED as well
     Create a code that will do the following: Scenario 4: When Button1 is pressed, all LEDs will be ON and should stay ON even after Button1 is released. When Button2 is pressed and released, all LEDs should be OFF

4. **Challenge #4 - Analog Read Potentiometer**
     ‚óè Connect a potentiometer to the Arduino
     ‚óè Use the serial monitor to read the values as you turn the knob
     ‚óè Feel free to connect an actuator (LED) and see if you can use PWM principlesto create a dimmer

## Requirements
